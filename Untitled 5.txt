I’m working to simplify our CSM/PM meeting cadences by combining the weekly CSM/PM interlock and the bi-weekly Product Scout calls into one weekly meeting. And I have split it up into two 30-min segments covering a subset of Data Platform portfolios as follows:
30 min – wx.ai; wxO; wx.gov
30 min – wx.data; CP4D

Since IKC does not have many current GitHub issues; and only a few Product Scout issues approved by WW; I would like to propose that we just cover IKC vai Slack. I expect I will reach out to you (or whoever you delegate) every couple weeks or so to get updates. Does that work for you?

I’m working to simplify our CSM/PM meeting cadences for Product Managers by combining the weekly CSM/PM interlock and the bi-weekly Product Scout calls into one weekly meeting. And I have split it up into two 30-min segments covering a subset of Data Platform portfolios in each; but neither directly covers IKC (we do have CP4D; and might add wx.data Intelligence.)

I am a WW Customer Success Practice Leader for Data Platform; and I lead a couple programs that require interlocks with Product Managers every week or two. The programs are:
Weekly CSM/PM interlock to review product issues raised by Customer Success Managers (CSMs) that might be blocking a client deployment
Bi-weekly Product Scout calls where we review the top enhancement Ideas/AHA requests raised by the field (pre or post sales)

@Javier-Frances @juandiego-garciahernandez Please add customers; financial impact; and timeline needed to the Idea.
