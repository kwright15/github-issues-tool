examples:
  - user: |
      Can you summarize the issues in the repository kwright15/github-issues-tool?
    agent: |
      I'll summarize the issues in the kwright15/github-issues-tool repository for you.

      Let me analyze the issues using the github_issues_summarize tool.

      Here's a summary of the issues in the repository:
      
      Total Issues: 3
      Open Issues: 2
      Closed Issues: 1
      
      Top Tags:
      - bug: 2 issues
      - enhancement: 1 issue
      - documentation: 1 issue
      
      Trending Themes:
      - "issue" appears in 3 issues
      
      Would you like me to provide more details about any specific aspect of these issues?

  - user: |
      What are the analytics for the issues in the repository?
    agent: |
      I'll analyze the metrics for issues in the repository.

      Let me gather the analytics using the github_issues_metrics tool.

      Here are the key metrics for the issues:
      
      Monthly Issue Counts:
      - January 2025: 3 issues
      
      Time-to-Close Metrics:
      - Mean: 3 days
      - Median: 3 days
      - Minimum: 3 days
      - Maximum: 3 days
      
      Comment Activity:
      - Issues with comments: 3
      - Issues without comments: 0
      
      This data suggests consistent response times for closing issues, with all issues receiving comments.
      
      Would you like me to analyze any specific aspect of these metrics in more detail?

  - user: |
      Are there any similar issues in the repository?
    agent: |
      I'll check for similar or duplicate issues in the repository.

      Let me analyze the issues using the github_issues_detect_similar tool.

      I've found one group of similar issues:
      
      Group 1 (Similarity Score: 0.85):
      - Issue #1: "Issue 1"
      - Issue #3: "Issue 3"
      
      Recommendation: Consider merging these issues as they appear to be addressing the same topic.
      
      Would you like me to provide more details about these similar issues or check with a different similarity threshold?

  - user: |
      I'm creating a new issue with the title "Problem with API authentication" and body "I'm having trouble authenticating with the API. Getting 401 errors." Can you provide some guidance?
    agent: |
      I'll provide guidance for your new issue about API authentication problems.

      Let me analyze this using the github_issues_csm_intelligence tool.

      Based on my analysis of your new issue "Problem with API authentication":
      
      Similar Existing Issues:
      - Issue #1: "Issue 1" (https://github.com/example/repo/issues/1)
      
      Status: This appears to be an in-progress issue that the team is already working on.
      
      Recommended Tags:
      - bug
      - priority-medium
      
      Next Steps:
      1. Assign to PM for prioritization
      2. Request more information about the specific API endpoint and authentication method you're using
      
      I recommend checking the similar issue first to see if it addresses your problem. If not, when creating your issue, include details about:
      - The specific API endpoint you're trying to access
      - The authentication method you're using
      - Any error messages or response codes you're receiving
      - Steps to reproduce the issue
